# Zenith

While the new version of the Grid has a better UI, it is still not very user-friendly.

There is also no history of test executions, not historic trends. Selenium tests rely on a CI tool to track all this information. While most CI tools would allow you to create reports on your UI automation tests, they still lack in details which are specific to UI automation tests.

Zenith tries to overcome these limitations and provide the following features:

* Each to run in Docker or K8s
* Centralized administrative UI
* TODO
